### Adding scrolling effect for the header.

**Lesson learned**: .scrollTop property means to scroll down from the top of the document to its bottom. Not vice versa!!!

### Fixed the color display for the hamburger menu icon
The color of the icon doesn't show up because I forgot to change its color in header.css.

### Fixed the navbar
The div.container removed because it's unnecessary. The color of the each nav item changed from white to black due to the unordered list's white background.
